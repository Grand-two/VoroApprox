# Requirements
CGAL

# Compile
Just build the project by using CMake

# Useage
(1) load image -> init -> optimize to run the algorithm;

(2) after running algorithm, click 'approximate' button to compute an approximating image;

(3) scroll mouse middle button to zoom in and out; press mouse right button with motion to translate;

(4) left Alt + scroll mouse middle button to change point size; right Alt + scroll mouse middle button to change line width;
